## A tool for converting raw rgb565 data to bmp
Support: Windows, Unix-like
Compile: make/gcc vs2012. That is written in c99 and base on SDL. I think it is easy to port to others compiler/OS.
It is a tool for converting raw rgb565 data to bmp. I will make it support more format(rgb888,yuv....) in the future.
